THREE AXIS ROBOT ARM DESIGN CAN DIVIDE COLORED OBJECT AUTONOMOUSLY

This is my last year project in Electrical & Electronics Engineering.
I have made a project that can divide colored objects autonomously with 3 axis robot arm.
For the project I have used CCS Compiler to program my PIC microcontroller and I made my PCB design in PROTEUS.
I also add my project Thesis in pdf.
NOTE!!
For code look main.c
